A community repo with the express goal of making as many snaps available as possible. They may be incomplete fauly or unmaintained. The goal is to eventually slowly polish the packages through drive by PRs, and github issues. Popular and well maintained packages should eventually be moved to snapcraft.

Feel free to open PRs or issues for any existing *or missing* snap packages!
